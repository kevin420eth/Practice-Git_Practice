Hi my name's Kevin, my favorite NBA player is Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Kobe Bryant.

BTW, Lebron James is a sucker

In the 60s, Center is a powerful position but now most centers are just some kind of role players in the teams

But there are still some great centers/power forwards in 2000s, like Nikola Jokic, Joel Embed...etc
